## HOSPITAL SYSTEM Project With OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Welcome to the project repository, which is a small college project in which a hospital system was to be created according to the class diagram that was placed in the project by the professor.

## Image of the Project Class Diagram

As you can see in the image There are many Classes within the System that must be developed, I will make a list of these classes here for you to view,

Let's start by listing the Abstract Classes:

- Email
- Address
- Employee
- Person
- Physical person
- Legal person
- Telephone

Now we will list the Company Classes:

- Wing
- Hospital
- Room
- Living room

Continuing we have the Hospital Classes:

- Nurse
- Illness
- Doctor
- Patient

We will have Classes that are project interfaces:

- Health professional

## Detailed Explanation

This Project was entirely made in the Java language:.
<div align="center">
<img align="center" alt="java" width="15%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg">
</div>

This language, in our case, was the standard for us to learn object-oriented programming.
